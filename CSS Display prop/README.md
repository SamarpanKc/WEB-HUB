# Display Properties
## Inline
*Default Value:* The default value is inline for most elements, meaning the element is treated as an inline-level box.

*Behavior:* Elements with display: inline do not start on a new line and take up the remaining screen width, not creating a new block-level box.

*Other Values:* The display property also allows values like block, inline-block, and more, each affecting the layout and behavior of the element.

## Incline-Block
`display: inline-block;` allows setting width and height on an element, unlike display: inline.

The major difference compared to display: inline is the ability to apply dimensions, making it suitable for inline elements with specified sizes.
