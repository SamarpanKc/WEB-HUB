# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# REACT

React is a library, not a framework

Library target an especific functionality

Diffrences?

- **Library**: Think of a library as a toolbox. It provides a collection of pre-written code snippets and functions that you can use to perform specific tasks. You call the functions you need, and you're in control of when and how to use them. Examples include React (for building user interfaces) and jQuery (for DOM manipulation).
- **Framework**: A framework, on the other hand, is like a blueprint for building a house. It provides a structured way to build applications and often dictates the overall structure and flow of your application. With a framework, the framework itself often calls your code and helps manage the app's flow. Examples include Angular and Django.

In summary, libraries provide tools for you to use as needed, while frameworks provide a structured environment to build applications. Think of it as **you call a library,** but **a framework calls you**. ðŸ“šðŸ”§

we can  only import a single tag in functionâ†’ `return( <div> </div> )`, but if we want multiplr just warp `retrun( <> â€¦.tagsâ€¦.. </> )` like this.
