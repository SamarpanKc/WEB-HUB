# HTML Input Element:
The <input> element is a fundamental part of HTML forms. It is used to collect various types of user input, such as text, checkboxes, radio buttons, and more. You can customize its behaviour using attributes like type, name, and value.
# Input Types: 
The <input> element's type attribute specifies the expected input type. Common types include text, checkbox, radio, and submit. Each type serves a specific purpose in form design and data collection.
# Forms: 
HTML forms are created using the { <form> } element as a container for various input elements. Forms are used to structure and manage user input, and they provide a way to submit data to a server for processing. The <form> element can have attributes like action and method to define where and how the data is processed
