# Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. 
Here's a quick overview of some fundamental concepts:

## Console Output

JavaScript often uses the `console.log()` function to output information to the console, which is a helpful tool for debugging and understanding how your code is running.

- ```javascript
  console.log("Hello, JavaScript!");
This line will print "Hello, JavaScript!" to the browser console.

## Variables
In JavaScript, you can use variables to store and manipulate data. Variable names should be meaningful and follow certain rules:
- ```javascript
  let message = "Welcome to JavaScript!";
Here, we've declared a variable named `message` and assigned it the value "Welcome to JavaScript!"

## Alert Dialogs
The alert() function is a simple way to display information in a pop-up dialog box in the browser:
- ```javascript
  alert("This is an alert!");
This line will display a pop-up with the message "This is an alert!"

## Commenting
Comments in JavaScript are used to provide explanations within the code. They are not executed and are ignored by the JavaScript interpreter:
- ```javascript
  // This is a single-line comment

  /*
     This is a
     multi-line comment
  */
Comments help improve code readability and understanding.
