# FONTS
1. **Font Properties in CSS:** You can define the font of a text using the font-family property in CSS. It allows you to specify the typeface or font family you want to use for text. If the font name is more than one word, enclose it in quotation marks (e.g., "Times New Roman"). You can also set other properties like size and weight using the font-size and font-weight properties, among others.
2. **Web Safe Fonts:** There are some fonts that are widely available on most devices. These are called web-safe fonts. Some common web-safe fonts include Arial, Verdana, Tahoma (sans-serif), and Times New Roman (serif).
3. **@font-face Rule:** To use custom fonts that are not installed on the user's computer, you can use the @font-face rule. This rule allows web designers to include font files in their CSS so that the browser can download and use them for rendering text.
4. **Font Families:** CSS supports various font families, and you can specify a fallback in case the preferred font isn't available on a user's system. For example, using font-family: Arial, sans-serif means the browser will use Arial if available and a generic sans-serif font if it's not.

# TEXTS
1. **Text Formatting:** CSS properties like text-align, text-transform, and color are used to control the alignment, capitalization, and color of text, respectively.
2. **Text Effects:** The writing-mode property can be used to specify whether text is laid out horizontally or vertically, enabling unique text orientations.
3. **Text Alignment and Direction:** Properties like text-align, text-align-last, direction, and unicode-bidi help control text alignment and direction, which can be particularly useful for handling multilingual text.
4. **Text Decoration:** CSS provides properties to specify text decorations such as underline, overline, and line-through. These properties control the style and kind of text decoration applied to text elements.

# COLORS
1. **Predefined Color Names:** CSS provides a set of predefined color names such as "red," "blue," and "green" that you can use to set the color of elements. These names are easy to use and remember.
2. **Hexadecimal (HEX) Values:** Colors can be defined using HEX values, like #RRGGBB, where RR, GG, and BB are two-digit hexadecimal values representing the red, green, and blue components of the color.
3. **RGB and RGBA Values:** You can use RGB values like rgb(R, G, B) or RGBA values like rgba(R, G, B, A) where R, G, and B represent the red, green, and blue components, and A represents the alpha (transparency) value.
4. **HSL and HSLA Values:** CSS allows specifying colors using HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) and HSLA (with an alpha channel) values. This provides greater control over the color's appearance.
